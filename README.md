# GO2Grasscutter

This tool can read GOOD data and convert it into Grasscutter's `give` commands. You may find your GOOD data from GO's settings page [here](https://tinyurl.com/t9vtb3fr). You can also generate your own `give` artifact command by using the generator.

Please be aware that this tool can only generate __VALID__ artifacts as per the official servers. Any attempt to put in invalid substats will result in an error. If you believe that you do have a valid artifact but the tool still thinks that it's invalid, then please do notify me through the issues tab.

## The `give` command
Further explaination on the give command can be found in Grasscutter's wiki page [here](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/wiki/Commands#give-command).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Bugs

If you happen to run into any bugs, please do report them in the issues tab and I will do my best to fix them.
