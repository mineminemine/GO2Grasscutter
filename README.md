# GO2Grasscutter

This tool can read Genshin Optimizer's GOOD data and convert it into Grasscutter's `give` commands. You can also generate your own artifact by using the generator.

Please be aware that this tool can only generate __VALID__ artifacts, as per the official servers.

## The `give` command
Further explaination on the give command can be found in Grasscutter's wiki page [here](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/wiki/Commands#give-command).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Bugs

If you happen to run into any bugs, please do report them in the issues tab and I will do my best to fix them.
