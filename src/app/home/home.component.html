          This tool reads Genshin Optimizer's (GO) JSON Data and converts it to
          Grasscutter's giveart commands. You can find your JSON data on GO's
          Settings page

          >. Unfortunately, the giveart commands that are generated by the tool
          cannot be used within the game itself due to the character limit in
          the chat window. You will need to put the giveart commands into the
          server command console in order to make it work, thus requiring access
          to it.

          Note: This tool cannot obtain your artifact data directly from the
          official servers. You will need to manually put them in GO before
          using this tool. See GO's homepage if you need a tutorial on how to
          get your artifact added into GO.
