          This tool reads GOOD data and converts it to
          Grasscutter's 'give' commands. You can find your GOOD data in GO's
          Settings page

          The 'give' commands that are generated by GO2Grasscutter cannot be
          used within the game itself due to the character limit for the game's
          chat window. You will need to put the 'give' commands into the
          server's terminal in order to make the commands work, thus requiring
          access to the server's terminal.

          Note: This tool cannot obtain your artifact data directly from the
          official servers. You will need to manually put them in GO before
          using this tool. See GO's homepage if you need a tutorial on how to
          get your artifact added into GO.
